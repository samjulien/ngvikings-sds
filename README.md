This is the sample project for [Sam Julien](https://twitter.com/samjulien) and [Mike Ryan's](https://twitter.com/MikeRyanDev) talk at [ngVikings 2019](https://ngvikings.org/schedule/2019-05-27?sessionId=203): "STORE TREK: The Voygage to Angular."

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.0-rc.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
